	abstract = {Successful mating of female mosquitoes typically occurs once, with the male sperm being stored in the female spermatheca for every subsequent oviposition event. The female spermatheca is responsible for the maintenance, nourishment, and protection of the male sperm against damage during storage. Aedes aegypti is a major vector of arboviruses, including Yellow Fever, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika. Vector control is difficult due to this mosquito high reproductive capacity.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary vectors of numerous viruses that impact human health. As manipulation of reproduction has been proposed to suppress mosquito populations, elucidation of biological processes that enable males and females to successfully reproduce is necessary. One essential process is female sperm storage in specialized structures called spermathecae. Aedes aegypti females typically mate once, requiring them to maintain sperm viably to fertilize eggs they lay over their lifetime. Spermathecal gene products are required for Drosophila sperm storage and sperm viability, and a spermathecal-derived heme peroxidase is required for long-term Anopheles gambiae fertility. Products of the Ae. aegypti spermathecae, and their response to mating, are largely unknown. Further, although female blood-feeding is essential for anautogenous mosquito reproduction, the transcriptional response to blood-ingestion remains undefined in any reproductive tissue. We conducted an RNAseq analysis of spermathecae from unfed virgins, mated only, and mated and blood-fed females at 6, 24, and 72 h post-mating and identified significant differentially expressed genes in each group at each timepoint. A blood-meal following mating induced a greater transcriptional response in the spermathecae than mating alone. This study provides the first view of elicited mRNA changes in the spermathecae by a blood-meal in mated females.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti is the most synanthropic and anthropophilic mosquito of Culicidae. This species always cohabits with humans and is extremely opportunistic. Vector dispersal is directly related to the ability of the females on successfully finding a mate in a generally patchy urban scenario. In the present work, we investigate transcriptional changes in Ae. aegypti females during the courtship process and after mating. We observe a substantial alteration in gene expression triggered just upon contact with Ae. aegypti males, which in turn was not fully correlated to the changes triggered by the contact. After analysing shared significant differentially regulated genes between conspecific contact and insemination, the major part of the observed transcriptomic change triggered by contact is reversed after mating, indicating an intermediary situation between naive and mating conditions that we hypothesize to be crucial for mating success. Upon contact, several chemosensory related genes are repressed, especially odorant binding proteins. Most of these genes return to higher expression rates after mating. None of these genes are significantly regulated by the encounter of a different species, Aedes albopictus. The results presented here might be applied to an innovative control approach focusing on the semiochemical systems of mosquitoes in an effort to disrupt undesirable host–insect interaction to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission to humans.},

	abstract = {The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a significant public health threat, as it is the main vector of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Disease control efforts could be enhanced through reproductive manipulation of these vectors. Previous work has revealed a relationship between male seminal fluid proteins transferred to females during mating and female post-mating physiology and behavior. To better understand this interplay, we used short-read RNA sequencing to identify gene expression changes in the lower reproductive tract of females in response to mating. We characterized mRNA expression in virgin and mated females at 0, 6 and 24 hours post-mating (hpm) and identified 364 differentially abundant transcripts between mating status groups. Surprisingly, 60 transcripts were more abundant at 0hpm compared to virgin females, suggesting transfer from males. Twenty of these encode known Ae. aegypti seminal fluid proteins. Transfer and detection of male accessory gland-derived mRNA in females at 0hpm was confirmed by measurement of eGFP mRNA in females mated to eGFP-expressing males. In addition, 150 transcripts were up-regulated at 6hpm and 24hpm, while 130 transcripts were down-regulated at 6hpm and 24hpm. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that proteases, a protein class broadly known to play important roles in reproduction, were among the most enriched protein classes. RNAs associated with immune system and antimicrobial function were also up-regulated at 24hpm. Collectively, our results suggest that copulation initiates broad transcriptome changes across the mosquito female reproductive tract, “priming” her for important subsequent processes of blood feeding, egg development and immune defense. Our transcriptome analysis provides a vital foundation for future studies of the consequences of mating on female biology and will aid studies seeking to identify specific gene families, molecules and pathways that support key reproductive processes in the female mosquito.},
